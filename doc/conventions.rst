 Conventions for transforms
============================

For the transforms we have coded here, we have followed some conventions
that are not universal, but seem common enough.

Transformation matrices are matrices for application on the left.  That is, if you are transforming a set of points, where the points are vectors $V_1, V_2 \\ellipsis N$
